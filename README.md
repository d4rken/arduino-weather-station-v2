* Both stations need to be in the same WiFi
* Indoor station runs an MQTT broker
* Outdoor station sends data to MQTT broker
* Indoor station subscribes to it's own topics and display the information
* Outdoor station uses deep sleep (3min) to conserve battery
* üç∞ approximate uptime is stored in RTC memory during deep sleep

## Indoor
* Wemos D1 mini
* Waveshare 1.54" e-Paper Display
* USB powered

## Outdoor
* Wemos D1 mini
* BME280
* 2x 4000mah Lithium Cells
